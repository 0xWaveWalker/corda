Welcome to the R3 prototyping repository!
=========================================

This documentation describes the first prototype of a possible future R3 shared ledger platform.

The goal of this prototype is to explore fundamentally better designs for transactions, states and smart contract APIs
than what presently exists on the market, tailor made for the needs of the financial industry. We are attempting to
prove or disprove the following hypothesis:

*The combination of*

* *An upgraded state transition model*
* *Industry standard, production quality virtual machines and languages*
* *Limited data propagation*
* *Conflict resolution without proof of work or blocks*

*is sufficiently powerful to justify the creation of a new platform implementation.*
