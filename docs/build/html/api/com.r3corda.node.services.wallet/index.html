method to auto-generate some self-issued cash states that can be used for test trading. A real wallet would persist
states relevant to us into a database and once such a wallet is implemented, this scaffolding can be removed.</p>

because we own them. This class represents an immutable, stable state of a wallet: it is guaranteed not to
change out from underneath you, even though the canonical currently-best-known wallet may change as we learn
about new transactions from our peers and generate new transactions that consume states ourselves.</p>
