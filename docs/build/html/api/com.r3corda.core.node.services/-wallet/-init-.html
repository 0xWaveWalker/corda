<p>A wallet (name may be temporary) wraps a set of states that are useful for us to keep track of, for instance,
because we own them. This class represents an immutable, stable state of a wallet: it is guaranteed not to
change out from underneath you, even though the canonical currently-best-known wallet may change as we learn
about new transactions from our peers and generate new transactions that consume states ourselves.</p>
<p>This absract class has no references to Cash contracts.</p>
