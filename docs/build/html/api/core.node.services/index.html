<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">ArtemisMessagingService</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="../core.messaging/-messaging-service/index.html"><span class="identifier">MessagingService</span></a></code><p>This class implements the <a href="../core.messaging/-messaging-service/index.html">MessagingService</a> API using Apache Artemis, the successor to their ActiveMQ product.
Artemis is a message queue broker and here, we embed the entire server inside our own process. Nodes communicate
with each other using (by default) an Artemis specific protocol, but it supports other protocols like AQMP/1.0
as well.</p>

<a href="-attachment-storage/index.html">AttachmentStorage</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">AttachmentStorage</span></code><p>An attachment store records potentially large binary objects, identified by their hash. Note that attachments are
immutable and can never be erased once inserted</p>

<a href="-data-vending-service/index.html">DataVendingService</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">DataVendingService</span></code><p>This class sets up network message handlers for requests from peers for data keyed by hash. It is a piece of simple
glue that sits between the network layer and the database layer.</p>

</td>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="-identity-service/index.html">IdentityService</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">IdentityService</span></code><p>An identity service maintains an bidirectional map of <a href="../core/-party/index.html">Party</a>s to their associated public keys and thus supports
lookup of a party given its key. This is obviously very incomplete and does not reflect everything a real identity
service would provide.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="-key-management-service/index.html">KeyManagementService</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">KeyManagementService</span></code><p>The KMS is responsible for storing and using private keys to sign things. An implementation of this may, for example,
call out to a hardware security module that enforces various auditing and frequency-of-use requirements.</p>

<a href="-node-timestamper-service/index.html">NodeTimestamperService</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">NodeTimestamperService</span></code><p>This class implements the server side of the timestamping protocol, using the local clock. A future version might
add features like checking against other NTP servers to make sure the clock hasnt drifted by too much.</p>

<td>
<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">NodeWalletService</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="-wallet-service/index.html"><span class="identifier">WalletService</span></a></code><p>This class implements a simple, in memory wallet that tracks states that are owned by us, and also has a convenience
method to auto-generate some self-issued cash states that can be used for test trading. A real wallet would persist
states relevant to us into a database and once such a wallet is implemented, this scaffolding can be removed.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="-service-hub/index.html">ServiceHub</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">ServiceHub</span></code><p>A service hub simply vends references to the other services a node has. Some of those services may be missing or
mocked out. This class is useful to pass to chunks of pluggable code that might have need of many different kinds of
functionality and you dont want to hard-code which types in the interface.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="-storage-service/index.html">StorageService</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">StorageService</span></code><p>A sketch of an interface to a simple key/value storage system. Intended for persistence of simple blobs like
transactions, serialised protocol state machines and so on. Again, this isnt intended to imply lack of SQL or
anything like that, this interface is only big enough to support the prototyping work.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="-timestamper-service/index.html">TimestamperService</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">TimestamperService</span></code><p>Simple interface (for testing) to an abstract timestamping service. Note that this is not "timestamping" in the
blockchain sense of a total ordering of transactions, but rather, a signature from a well known/trusted timestamping
service over a transaction that indicates the timestamp in it is accurate. Such a signature may not always be
necessary: if there are multiple parties involved in a transaction then they can cross-check the timestamp
themselves.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="-wallet/index.html">Wallet</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">data</span> <span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">Wallet</span></code><p>A wallet (name may be temporary) wraps a set of states that are useful for us to keep track of, for instance,
because we own them. This class represents an immutable, stable state of a wallet: it is guaranteed not to
change out from underneath you, even though the canonical currently-best-known wallet may change as we learn
about new transactions from our peers and generate new transactions that consume states ourselves.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="-wallet-service/index.html">WalletService</a></td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">WalletService</span></code><p>A <a href="-wallet-service/index.html">WalletService</a> is responsible for securely and safely persisting the current state of a wallet to storage. The
wallet service vends immutable snapshots of the current wallet for working with: if you build a transaction based
on a wallet that isnt current, be aware that it may end up being invalid if the states that were used have been
consumed by someone else first</p>
