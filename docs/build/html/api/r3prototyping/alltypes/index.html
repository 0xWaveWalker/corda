command line tools, demos, tests etc. Just set the <a href="../core.utilities/-a-n-s-i-progress-renderer/progress-tracker.html">progressTracker</a> field and it will go ahead and start drawing
if the terminal supports it. Otherwise it just prints out the name of the step whenever it changes.</p>

<p>This class implements the <a href="../core.messaging/-messaging-service/index.html">MessagingService</a> API using Apache Artemis, the successor to their ActiveMQ product.
Artemis is a message queue broker and here, we embed the entire server inside our own process. Nodes communicate
with each other using (by default) an Artemis specific protocol, but it supports other protocols like AQMP/1.0
as well.</p>

<p>A message is defined, at this level, to be a (topic, timestamp, byte arrays) triple, where the topic is a string in

<p>This class lets you start up a <a href="../core.messaging/-messaging-service/index.html">MessagingService</a>. Its purpose is to stop you from getting access to the methods
on the messaging service interface until you have successfully started up the system. One of these objects should
be the only way to obtain a reference to a <a href="../core.messaging/-messaging-service/index.html">MessagingService</a>. Startup may be a slow process: some implementations
may let you cast the returned future to an object that lets you get status info.</p>

<td>
<p>A network map contains lists of nodes on the network along with information about their identity keys, services
they provide and host names or IP addresses where they can be connected to. A reasonable architecture for the
network map service might be one like the Tor directory authorities, where several nodes linked by RAFT or Paxos
elect a leader and that leader distributes signed documents describing the network layout. Those documents can
then be cached by every node and thus a network map can be retrieved given only a single successful peer connection.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.node/-node/index.html">core.node.Node</a></td>

<p>A Node manages a standalone server that takes part in the P2P network. It creates the services found in <a href="#">ServiceHub</a>,
loads important data off disk and starts listening for connections.</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.node.services/-node-timestamper-service/index.html">core.node.services.NodeTimestamperService</a></td>
<td>
<p>This class implements the server side of the timestamping protocol, using the local clock. A future version might
add features like checking against other NTP servers to make sure the clock hasnt drifted by too much.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.node.services/-node-wallet-service/index.html">core.node.services.NodeWalletService</a></td>
<td>
<p>This class implements a simple, in memory wallet that tracks states that are owned by us, and also has a convenience
method to auto-generate some self-issued cash states that can be used for test trading. A real wallet would persist
states relevant to us into a database and once such a wallet is implemented, this scaffolding can be removed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.protocols/-protocol-logic/index.html">core.protocols.ProtocolLogic</a></td>
<td>
<p>A sub-class of <a href="../core.protocols/-protocol-logic/index.html">ProtocolLogic</a> implements a protocol flow using direct, straight line blocking code. Thus you
can write complex protocol logic in an ordinary fashion, without having to think about callbacks, restarting after
a node crash, how many instances of your protocol there are running and so on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.protocols/-protocol-state-machine/index.html">core.protocols.ProtocolStateMachine</a></td>
<td>
<p>A ProtocolStateMachine instance is a suspendable fiber that delegates all actual logic to a <a href="../core.protocols/-protocol-logic/index.html">ProtocolLogic</a> instance.
For any given flow there is only one PSM, even if that protocol invokes subprotocols.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../protocols/-resolve-transactions-protocol/index.html">protocols.ResolveTransactionsProtocol</a></td>
<td>
<p>This protocol fetches each transaction identified by the given hashes from either disk or network, along with all
their dependencies, and verifies them together using a single <a href="#">TransactionGroup</a>. If no exception is thrown, then
all the transactions have been successfully verified and inserted into the local database.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.node.services/-service-hub/index.html">core.node.services.ServiceHub</a></td>
<td>
<p>A service hub simply vends references to the other services a node has. Some of those services may be missing or
mocked out. This class is useful to pass to chunks of pluggable code that might have need of many different kinds of
functionality and you dont want to hard-code which types in the interface.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.messaging/-single-message-recipient.html">core.messaging.SingleMessageRecipient</a></td>

<p>A base class for the case of point-to-point messages</p>

<tr>

<a href="../core.messaging/-state-machine-manager/index.html">core.messaging.StateMachineManager</a></td>
<td>
<p>A StateMachineManager is responsible for coordination and persistence of multiple <a href="../core.protocols/-protocol-state-machine/index.html">ProtocolStateMachine</a> objects.
Each such object represents an instantiation of a (two-party) protocol that has reached a particular point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.node.services/-storage-service/index.html">core.node.services.StorageService</a></td>
<td>
<p>A sketch of an interface to a simple key/value storage system. Intended for persistence of simple blobs like
transactions, serialised protocol state machines and so on. Again, this isnt intended to imply lack of SQL or
anything like that, this interface is only big enough to support the prototyping work.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../protocols/-timestamping-protocol/index.html">protocols.TimestampingProtocol</a></td>
<td>
<p>The TimestampingProtocol class is the client code that talks to a <a href="../core.node.services/-node-timestamper-service/index.html">NodeTimestamperService</a> on some remote node. It is a
<a href="../core.protocols/-protocol-logic/index.html">ProtocolLogic</a>, meaning it can either be a sub-protocol of some other protocol, or be driven independently.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.messaging/-topic-string-validator/index.html">core.messaging.TopicStringValidator</a></td>

and seller) and the following steps:</p>

<tr>

<a href="../core.utilities/-untrustworthy-data/index.html">core.utilities.UntrustworthyData</a></td>
<td>
<p>A small utility to approximate taint tracking: if a method gives you back one of these, it means the data came from
a remote source that may be incentivised to pass us junk that violates basic assumptions and thus must be checked
first. The wrapper helps you to avoid forgetting this vital step. Things you might want to check are:</p>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.node.services/-wallet/index.html">core.node.services.Wallet</a></td>
<td>
<p>A wallet (name may be temporary) wraps a set of states that are useful for us to keep track of, for instance,
because we own them. This class represents an immutable, stable state of a wallet: it is guaranteed not to
change out from underneath you, even though the canonical currently-best-known wallet may change as we learn
about new transactions from our peers and generate new transactions that consume states ourselves.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../core.node.services/-wallet-service/index.html">core.node.services.WalletService</a></td>
<td>
<p>A <a href="../core.node.services/-wallet-service/index.html">WalletService</a> is responsible for securely and safely persisting the current state of a wallet to storage. The
wallet service vends immutable snapshots of the current wallet for working with: if you build a transaction based
on a wallet that isnt current, be aware that it may end up being invalid if the states that were used have been
consumed by someone else first</p>
