<code><span class="identifier">FungibleAsset</span><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="symbol">)</span></code><br/>
<p>Superclass for contracts representing assets which are fungible, countable and issued by a specific party. States
contain assets which are equivalent (such as cash of the same currency), so records of their existence can
be merged or split as needed where the issuer is the same. For instance, dollars issued by the Fed are fungible and
countable (in cents), barrels of West Texas crude are fungible and countable (oil from two small containers
can be poured into one large container), shares of the same class in a specific company are fungible and
countable, and so on.</p>
<p>See <a href="../-cash/index.html">Cash</a> for an example subclass that implements currency.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<a name="T"></a>
<code>T</code> - a type that represents the asset in question. This should describe the basic type of the asset
(GBP, USD, oil, shares in company , etc.) and any additional metadata (issuer, grade, class, etc.)<br/>
