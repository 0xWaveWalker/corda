It contains one or more signatures, each one for
a public key that is mentioned inside a transaction command. SignedTransaction is the top level transaction type
and the type most frequently passed around the network and stored. The identity of a transaction is the hash
of a WireTransaction, therefore if you are storing data keyed by WT hash be aware that multiple different STs may
map to the same key (and they could be different in important ways, like validity). The signatures on a
SignedTransaction might be invalid or missing: the type does not imply validity.</p>

<code><span class="keyword">open</span> <span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">TransactionBuilder</span></code><p>A TransactionBuilder is a transaction class thats mutable (unlike the others which are all immutable). It is
intended to be passed around contracts that may edit it by adding new states/commands. Then once the states
and commands are right, this class can be used as a holding bucket to gather signatures from multiple parties.</p>

<td>
<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">WireTransaction</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="-base-transaction/index.html"><span class="identifier">BaseTransaction</span></a></code><p>A transaction ready for serialisation, without any signatures attached. A WireTransaction is usually wrapped
by a <a href="-signed-transaction/index.html">SignedTransaction</a> that carries the signatures over this payload. The hash of the wire transaction is
the identity of the transaction, that is, its possible for two <a href="-signed-transaction/index.html">SignedTransaction</a>s with different sets of
signatures to have the same identity hash.</p>
