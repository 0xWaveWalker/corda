notary is responsible for ensuring there is no "double spending" by only signing a transaction if the input states
are all free.</p>

It also has 4 commands, "Agree", "Fix", "Pay" and "Mature".
Currently, we are not interested (excuse pun) in valuing the swap, calculating the PVs, DFs and all that good stuff (soon though).
This is just a representation of a vanilla Fixed vs Floating (same currency) IRS in the R3 prototype model.</p>

<p>A TransactionBuilder is a transaction class thats mutable (unlike the others which are all immutable). It is
intended to be passed around contracts that may edit it by adding new states/commands. Then once the states
