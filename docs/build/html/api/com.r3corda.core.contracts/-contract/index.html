<h1>Contract</h1>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">Contract</span></code><br/>
<p>Implemented by a program that implements business logic on the shared ledger. All participants run this code for
every <a href="../-ledger-transaction/index.html">LedgerTransaction</a> they see on the network, for every input and output state. All contracts must accept the
transaction for it to be accepted: failure of any aborts the entire thing. The time is taken from a trusted
timestamp attached to the transaction itself i.e. it is NOT necessarily the current time.</p>

Must throw an exception if theres a problem that should prevent state transition. Takes a single object
rather than an argument so that additional data can be added without breaking binary compatibility with
existing contract code.</p>

States
contain assets which are equivalent (such as cash of the same currency), so records of their existence can
be merged or split as needed where the issuer is the same. For instance, dollars issued by the Fed are fungible and
countable (in cents), barrels of West Texas crude are fungible and countable (oil from two small containers
can be poured into one large container), shares of the same class in a specific company are fungible and
countable, and so on.</p>

<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">InterestRateSwap</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<span class="identifier">Contract</span></code><p>The Interest Rate Swap class. For a quick overview of what an IRS is, see here - http://www.pimco.co.uk/EN/Education/Pages/InterestRateSwapsBasics1-08.aspx (no endorsement)
This contract has 4 significant data classes within it, the "Common", "Calculation", "FixedLeg" and "FloatingLeg"
It also has 4 commands, "Agree", "Fix", "Pay" and "Mature".
Currently, we are not interested (excuse pun) in valuing the swap, calculating the PVs, DFs and all that good stuff (soon though).
This is just a representation of a vanilla Fixed vs Floating (same currency) IRS in the R3 prototype model.</p>
