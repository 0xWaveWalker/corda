<p>If you jumped here from a compiler error make sure the last line of your test tests for a transaction verify or fail.
This is a dummy type that can only be instantiated by functions in this module. This way we can ensure that all tests
will have as the last line either an accept or a failure test. The name is deliberately long to help make sense of
the triggered diagnostic.</p>
