Welcome to the Corda repository!
================================

This documentation describes the prototype of a proposed architecture for distributed ledgers.

The goal of this prototype is to explore fundamentally better designs for distributed ledgers than what presently exists
on the market, tailor made for the needs of the financial industry. We are attempting to prove or disprove the
following hypothesis:

The combination of

* An upgraded state transition model
* Industry standard, production quality virtual machines and languages
* An advanced orchestration framework
* Limited data propagation
* Conflict resolution without proof of work or blocks

is sufficiently powerful to justify the creation of a new platform implementation.
