Further Comments on Kotlin
--------------------------

Corda is written in a language called `Kotlin <https://kotlinlang.org/>`_. Kotlin is a language that targets the JVM
and can be thought of as a simpler Scala, with much better Java interop. It is developed by and has commercial support
from JetBrains, the makers of the IntelliJ IDE and other popular developer tools.

As Kotlin is very new, without a doubt you have not encountered it before. Don't worry: it is designed as a better
Java for industrial use and as such, the syntax was carefully designed to be readable even to people who don't know
the language, after only a few minutes of introduction.

Due to the seamless Java interop the use of Kotlin to extend the platform is *not* required and the tutorial shows how
to write contracts in both Kotlin and Java. You can `read more about why Kotlin is a potentially strong successor to Java here <https://medium.com/@octskyward/why-kotlin-is-my-next-programming-language-c25c001e26e3>`_.
