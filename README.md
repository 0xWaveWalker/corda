This source tree contains explorations of various design concepts the R3 DLG is exploring.

Things you need to know:

* The main documentation is in the form of a website in the git repository. Load [the website](docs/build/html/index.html)
  in the `docs/build/html` directory to start reading about what's included, how to get set up, and to read a tutorial
  on writing smart contracts in this framework.

* The code is a JVM project written mostly in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), which you can think of as a simpler
  version of Scala (or alternatively, a much better syntax for Java). Kotlin can be learned quickly and is designed
  to be readable, so you won't need to know it very well to understand what the code is doing. If you'd like to
  add new features, please read its documentation on the website.

  There is also Java code included, to demonstrate how to use the framework from a more familiar language.

* For bug tracking we use JIRA. For source control we use BitBucket. You should have received credentials for these
  services as part of getting set up. If you don't have access, please contact Richard Brown or James Carlyle.

* There is a mailing list for discussion, brainstorming etc called [r3dlg-awg](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/r3dlg-awg)
  which you should have been added to already. If you aren't on it, again, please get in touch.
