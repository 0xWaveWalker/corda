/**
 * A simple in-memory KMS that doesn't bother saving keys to disk. A real implementation would:
 *
 * - Probably be accessed via the network layer as an internal node service i.e. via a message queue, so it can run
 *   on a separate/firewalled service.
 * - Use the protocol framework so requests to fetch keys can be suspended whilst a human signs off on the request.
 * - Use deterministic key derivation.
 * - Possibly have some sort of TREZOR-like two-factor authentication ability
 *
 * etc
