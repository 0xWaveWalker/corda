/**
 * The TimestampingProtocol class is the client code that talks to a [NodeTimestamperService] on some remote node. It is a
 * [ProtocolLogic], meaning it can either be a sub-protocol of some other protocol, or be driven independently.
 *
 * If you are not yourself authoring a protocol and want to timestamp something, the [TimestampingProtocol.Client] class
 * implements the [TimestamperService] interface, meaning it can be passed to [TransactionBuilder.timestamp] to timestamp
 * the built transaction. Please be aware that this will block, meaning it should not be used on a thread that is handling
 * a network message: use it only from spare application threads that don't have to respond to anything.
