/**
 * A progress tracker helps surface information about the progress of an operation to a user interface or API of some
 * kind. It lets you define a set of _steps_ that represent an operation. A step is represented by an object (typically
 * a singleton).
 *
 * Steps may logically be children of other steps, which models the case where a large top level operation involves
 * sub-operations which may also have a notion of progress. If a step has children, then the tracker will report the
 * steps children as the "next step" after the parent. In other words, a parent step is considered to involve actual
 * reportable work and is a thing. If the parent step simply groups other steps, then you'll have to step over it
 * manually.
 *
 * Each step has a label. It is assumed by default that the label does not change. If you want a label to change, then
 * you can emit a [ProgressTracker.Change.Rendering] object on the [ProgressTracker.Step.changes] observable stream
 * after it changes. That object will propagate through to the top level trackers [changes] stream, which renderers can
 * subscribe to in order to learn about progress.
 *
 * An operation can move both forwards and backwards through steps, thus, a [ProgressTracker] can represent operations
 * that include loops.
 *
 * A progress tracker is *not* thread safe. You may move events from the thread making progress to another thread by
 * using the [Observable] subscribeOn call.
